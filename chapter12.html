				12.1.1 Introduction
			</h3>
			<p id="_id7" title="chapter12">
				The substructure is the component of a bridge that includes all elements supporting the superstructure. Its purpose is to transfer the loads from the superstructure to the foundation soil or rock.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id8" title="chapter12">
				An abutment is a substructure unit located at the end of a bridge. Its function is to provide end support for the bridge superstructure and to retain the approach roadway embankment. Wingwalls are also located at the ends of a bridge. Their function is only to retain the approach roadway embankment and not to provide end support for the bridge.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id9" title="chapter12">
				Wingwalls are considered part of the substructure component only if they are integral with the abutment. When there is an expansion joint or construction joint between the abutment and the wingwall, that wingwall is defined as an independent wingwall, i.e., a retaining wall, and not considered in the condition evaluation of the abutment-substructure component.

				Full Height Abutments and Stub Abutments
			</h5>
			<p id="_id25" title="chapter12">
				Full height abutments are used when shorter spans are desired or if there are Right-of-Way or terrain issues (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-4" title="Go to Figure 12.1.4">see Figure 12.1.4</a>). This reduces the initial superstructure costs. Stub abutments may be used when it is desirable to keep the abutments away from the underlying roadway or waterway (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-5" title="Go to Figure 12.1.5">see Figure 12.1.5</a>). Longer spans are required when stub abutments are used. Using stub abutments reduces the cost of the substructure but increases the cost of the superstructure.

			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4271">
				Open Abutments
			</h5>
			<p id="_id30" title="chapter12">
				Open, or spill-through, abutments are similar in construction to multi-column piers. Instead of being retained by a solid wall, the approach roadway embankment extends on a slope below the bridge seat and between (&#8220;through&#8221;) the supporting columns. Only the topmost few feet of the embankment are actually retained by the abutment cap (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-6" title="Go to Figure 12.1.6">see Figure 12.1.6</a>).
		  </p>
			<p id="_id31" title="chapter12">
				The advantages of the open abutment are lower construction cost since most of the horizontal load is eliminated, so the massive construction and heavy reinforcement usually associated with the abutment stem is not needed. This substructure type has the ability to convert the abutment to a pier if additional spans are added in the future.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id32" title="chapter12">
				Open abutment disadvantages include a tendency for the fill to settle around the columns since good compaction is difficult to achieve in the confined spaces. Excessive erosion or scour may also occur in the fore slope. Rock fill is sometimes used to counter these problems. This abutment type is not suitable adjacent to streams due to susceptibility to scour.
		  </p>

				Integral Abutments and Semi-Integral Abutments
			</h5>
			<p id="_id35" title="chapter12">
				Most bridges have superstructures that are independent of the substructure to accommodate bridge length changes due to thermal effects. Expansion devices such as deck joints and expansion bearings allow for thermal movements but deteriorate quickly and create a wide range of maintenance needs for the bridge. In extreme cases, lack of movement due to failed expansion devices can lead to undesirable stresses in the bridge. Integral abutments supported by a single row of piles are becoming more popular and provide a solution to these problems.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id36" title="chapter12">
				In this design, the superstructure and substructure are integral and act as one unit without an expansion joint (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-7" title="Go to Figure 12.1.7">see Figure 12.1.7</a>). Relative movement of the abutment with respect to the backfill allows the structure to adjust to thermal expansions and contractions. Pavement joints at the ends of approach slabs are provided to accommodate the relative movement between the bridge and the approach roadway pavement.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id37" title="chapter12">
				The advantage of the integral abutment is that it lacks bearing devices and joints to repair, or replace, or maintain (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-8" title="Go to Figure 12.1.8">see Figure 12.1.8</a>). There are two disadvantages of integral abutments: settlement of the roadway approach due to undercompaction of backfill; and cracking of the abutment concrete due to movement restriction caused by overcompaction of backfill or superstructure rotations due to heavy skews.

			<p id="_id43" title="chapter12">
				Semi-integral abutments are similar to integral abutments, however, the superstructure and the top of the abutment act as one unit, but the bottom portion act independently of the superstructure. This is achieved by a joint between the top and bottom portions of the abutment which will allow for un-restrained rotation and thermal movement.

				Less Common Abutment Types

			<p id="_id45" title="chapter12">
				Some Agencies utilize additional, less common abutment types.
			</p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4273">
				Mechanically Stabilized Earth Abutments
			</h5>
			<p id="_id46" title="chapter12">
				Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) abutment typically consists of precast concrete panels, metallic soil reinforcing strips (flat strips or welded bar grids), and backfill to support the superstructure and support the roadway approach roadway embankment (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-9" title="Go to Figure 12.1.9">see Figure 12.1.9</a>). Two MSE abutment design concepts have been used. The first utilizes an MSE wall supporting a slab, or coping, on which the bridge bearings rest. Vertical loads are transmitted through the reinforced fill. The second concept utilizes piles or columns to support a stub abutment at the top of the reinforced fill. The piles provide vertical support for the bridge. The MSE provides lateral support for the approach roadway embankment. Problems have occurred when the MSE wall supports the bearings, since the MSE walls bulge out when they support vertical superstructure loads, which are transmitted through the bearings. Current construction practices call for stub abutments behind the MSE wall.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id47" title="chapter12">
				Precast vertical concrete panels are erected first, followed by the placement and compaction of a layer of backfill. The layers of backfill are sometimes referred to as &#8220;lifts.&#8221; Horizontal soil reinforcement is then placed and bolted to the panels and covered with more backfill (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-10" title="Go to Figure 12.1.10">see Figure 12.1.10</a>). This process, which allows the wall to remain stable during construction, is repeated until the designed height is attained.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id48" title="chapter12">
				Advantages of this substructure are its internal stability and its ability to counteract shear forces, especially during earthquakes. It is generally lower in cost and has favorable esthetics when compared to a reinforced concrete full height abutment. Disadvantages include difficulty in repairing failed soil reinforcement and limited site applications. Another disadvantage is the possible settlement of an MSE wall that directly supports the superstructure (i.e. no stub abutment with piles).

				Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil Abutments
			</h5>
			<p id="_id54" title="chapter12">
				Another less common, fairly new type of abutment is the geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS) abutment. GRS abutments are basically constructed on a level surface starting with a base structure of common, but high quality, cinder blocks. Fill is then placed and compacted with a sheet of geosynthetic reinforcement, which can be a series of polymer sheets or grids. These materials are layered until the designed height is attained. GRS abutments, which are internally supported, use friction to hold the blocks together and obtain their strength through proper spacing of the layers of reinforcement. Advantages of GRS abutments are their simplicity to construct and their aesthetic appearance. GRS technology works well with simple overpasses; however, they are not ideal where severe flooding or scour could occur (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-11" title="Go to Figure 12.1.11">see Figures 12.1.11</a> and <a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-12" title="Go to Figure 12.1.12">12.1.12</a>).

				Primary and Secondary Reinforcement 
			</h4>
			<p id="_id73" title="chapter12">
				The pattern of primary steel reinforcement used in concrete abutments depends on the abutment type (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-18" title="Go to Figure 12.1.18">see Figure 12.1.18</a>). In a cantilever abutment, primary tension reinforcement include: vertical bars in the rear face of the stem and backwall, horizontal bars in the bottom of the footing (toe steel), and horizontal bars in the top of the footing (heel steel). In a concrete open or spill-through abutment, the primary reinforcement consists of both tension and shear steel reinforcement. Tension steel reinforcement generally consists of vertical bars in the rear face of the backwall and cap beam, horizontal bars in the bottom face of the cap beam, vertical bars in the columns and horizontal bars in the bottom of the footing. Stirrups are used to resist shear in the cap beam. The column spirals or ties are generally considered to be secondary reinforcement to reduce the un-braced length of the vertical bars in the column (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-19" title="Go to Figure 12.1.19">see Figure 12.1.19</a>). The spirals or ties may be considered primary reinforcement in seismic zones. Bars used for temperature and shrinkage reinforcement are considered secondary reinforcement.

				The bridge seat provides a bearing area that supports the bridge superstructure. The backwall retains the approach roadway sub-base and keeps it from sliding onto the bridge seat. It also provides support for the approach slab and for the expansion joint, if one is present. The cheek wall is mostly cosmetic but also protects the end bearings from the elements, (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-20" title="Go to Figure 12.1.20">see Figure 12.1.20</a>).

			<p id="_id82" title="chapter12">
				The abutment stem or breast wall supports the bridge seat and retains the soil behind the abutment. The foundation, either spread footing or deep foundation (piles, drilled shafts, etc.), transmits the weight of the abutment, the soil backfill loads, and the bridge reactions to the supporting soil or rock (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-21" title="Go to Figure 12.1.21">see Figure 12.1.21</a>). It also provides stability against overturning and sliding forces. The portion of the footing in front of the wall is called the toe, and the portion behind the wall, under the approach embankment, is called the heel.

				Mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) walls consist of a reinforced soil mass and a concrete facing which is vertical or near vertical. The facing is often precast panels which are used to hold the soil in position at the face of the wall. The reinforced soil mass consists of select granular backfill. The tensile reinforcements and their connections may be proprietary, and may employ either metallic (i.e., strip&#x2011; or grid&#x2011;type) or polymeric (i.e., sheet&#x2011;, strip&#x2011;, or grid&#x2011;type) reinforcement. The soil reinforcing strips hold the wall facing panels in position and provide reinforcement for the soil. Geotextiles are used to cover the joint between the panels. Geotextiles are placed behind the precast panels to keep the soil from being eroded through the joints and allow excess water to flow out. Tie backs are steel bars or strands grouted into the soil or rock behind the abutment stem. Tie backs, if present, are used when lateral earth forces cannot be resisted by the footing alone.

				Foundation Types
			</h4>
			<p id="_id87" title="chapter12">
				Foundations are critical to the stability of the bridge since the foundation ultimately supports the entire structure. The two basic types of bridge foundations shown in <a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-21" title="Go to Figure 12.1.21">Figure 12.1.21</a> are:
		  </p>
			<ul id="_id824" title="chapter12">
				<li id="_id555" title="chapter12">
					Spread footings
				</li>
				<li id="_id556" title="chapter12">
					Deep foundations
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="_id88" title="chapter12">
				A spread footing is used when bedrock is close to the ground surface or when the soil is capable of supporting the bridge. A spread footing is typically a rectangular reinforced concrete slab. This type of foundation &#8220;spreads out&#8221; or distributes the loads from the bridge to the underlying rock or soil. While a spread footing is usually buried, it is generally covered with a minimal amount of soil. In cold regions, the bottom of a spread footing is placed below the recognized maximum frost line depth for that area.

			<p id="_id91" title="chapter12">
				A deep foundation is used when the soil is not suited for supporting the bridge.
			</p>
			<p id="_id92" title="chapter12">
				A pile is a long, slender support which is typically driven into the ground but can be placed in predrilled holes. Piles can be partially exposed and are made of steel, concrete (cast-in-place or precast), or timber (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-22" title="Go to Figure 12.1.22">see Figure 12.1.22</a>). Various numbers and configurations of piles can be used to support a bridge foundation. This type of foundation transfers load to sound material well below the surface or, in the case of friction piles, to the surrounding soil.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id93" title="chapter12">
				&#8220;Caisson&#8221;, &#8220;drilled shaft&#8221;, or &#8220;bored pile&#8221; is another type of deep foundation used when the soil is not competent to support a spread footing. Holes are drilled through the soil and filled with reinforced concrete. Temporary or permanent steel casing is utilized during the construction process to support and retain the sides of a borehole. Temporary steel casing is removed after the concrete is placed and is capable of withstanding the surrounding pressures. The minimum caisson diameter used for bridge substructure construction is normally 30 inches. Caissons, drilled shafts or bored piles may be extended through voids such as caverns or mines to reach bedrock under the bridge.

				12.1.3 Design Characteristics of Wingwalls
			</h3>
			<h4 class="Section-Heading" id="_id97" title="chapter12">
				General
			</h4>
			<p id="_id98" title="chapter12">
				Wingwalls are located on the sides of an abutment and enclose the approach fill. Wingwalls are generally considered to be retaining walls since they are designed to maintain a difference in ground surface elevations on the two sides of the wall (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-23" title="Go to Figure 12.1.23">see Figure 12.1.23</a>).
		  </p>
			<p id="_id99" title="chapter12">
				A wingwall is similar to an abutment except that it is not required to carry any loads from the superstructure. The absence of the vertical superstructure load usually necessitates a wider footing to resist the overturning moment or horizontal sliding due to lateral earth pressure.

				12.1.4 Inspection Methods and Locations
			</h3>
			<p id="_id125" title="chapter12">
				The inspection methods and locations for most wingwalls are similar to those for abutments. Many of the problems that occur in abutments are also common in wingwalls.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Section-Heading" id="_id126" title="chapter12">
				Methods
			</h4>
			<p id="_id127" title="chapter12">
				The specific visual, physical and advanced inspection methods are dependent upon the type of material used in the abutment and wingwalls. The inspection method used is based on the type of material the abutment or wingwall is made of and the methods are similar to the inspection of superstructures. <a class="figureItem" href="chapter6?_id16" title="Go to Topic 6.1">See Topics 6.1</a> and 15.1 (Timber), <a class="figureItem" href="chapter6?_id213" title="Go to Topic 6.2">Topics 6.2</a> and 15.2 (Concrete), <a class="figureItem" href="chapter6?_id576" title="Go to Topic 6.3">6.3</a> and 15.3 (Steel), or <a class="figureItem" href="chapter6?_id798" title="Go to Topic 6.4">Topic 6.4</a> (Stone Masonry) for specific material defects and inspection methods.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Section-Heading" id="_id128" title="chapter12">
				Visual
			</h4>
			<p id="_id129" title="chapter12">
				There are two types of visual inspections that may be required of an inspector. The first, called a routine inspection, involves reviewing the previous inspection report and visually examining the members of the bridge. A routine inspection involves a visual assessment to identify obvious defects.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id130" title="chapter12">
				The second type of visual inspection is called an in-depth inspection. An in-depth inspection is an inspection of one or more members above or below the water level to identify any deficiencies not readily detectable using routine methods. Hands-on inspection may be necessary at some locations. This type of visual inspection requires the inspector to visually assess every defective surface at a distance no further than an arm’s length. Surfaces are given close visual attention to quantify and qualify any defects.

				Physical
			</h5>
			<p id="_id151" title="chapter12">
				Once the defects are identified visually, physical methods are used to verify the extent of the defect. Carefully measure and record deficiencies found during physical inspection methods.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id152" title="chapter12">
				Areas of concrete or rebar deterioration identified visually need to be examined physically using an inspection hammer. This hands-on effort verifies the extent of the deficiency and its severity. A delaminated area has a distinctive hollow &#8220;clacking&#8221; sound when tapped with a hammer. The location, length and width of cracks found during the visual inspection need to be measured and recorded.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id153" title="chapter12">
				For steel members, the main physical inspection methods involve the use of an inspection hammer or wire brush. Excessive hammering, brushing or grinding may close surface cracks and make the cracks difficult to find. Corrosion results in loss of member material. This partial loss of cross section due to corrosion is known as section loss. Section loss may be measured using a straight edge and a tape measure. However, a more exact method of measurement, such as calipers or an ultrasonic thickness gauge (D-meter), are used to measure the remaining section of steel. The inspector removes all corrosion products (rust scale) prior to taking measurements.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id154" title="chapter12">
				For timber members, an inspection hammer is used to tap on areas and determine the extent of internal decay. This is done by listening to the sound the hammer makes. If it sounds hollow, internal decay may be present.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4276">
				Advanced Inspection Methods
			</h5>
			<p id="_id155" title="chapter12">
				If the extent of the deficiency cannot be determined by the visual and physical inspection methods described above, advanced inspection methods are used.

				Locations

			<p id="_id163" title="chapter12">
				Stability is a paramount concern; therefore checking for various forms of movement is required during the inspection of abutments and wingwalls.
			</p>
			<p id="_id164" title="chapter12">
				The locations for inspection can be related to common abutment and wingwall problems.
			</p>
			<p id="_id165" title="chapter12">
				The most common problems observed during the inspection of abutments and wingwalls are associated with:
			</p>
			<ul id="_id837" title="chapter12">
				<li id="_id657" title="chapter12">
					Areas subjected to movement

			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4277">
				Areas Subjected to Movement
			</h5>
			<p id="_id166" title="chapter12">
				The most common types of movement observed during the inspection of abutments and wingwalls are:
			</p>
			<ul id="_id838" title="chapter12">
				<li id="_id664" title="chapter12">
					Vertical movement
				</li>
				<li id="_id665" title="chapter12">
					Lateral movement
				</li>
				<li id="_id666" title="chapter12">
					Rotational movement
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="_id167" title="chapter12">
				Vertical movement can occur in the form of uniform settlement or differential settlement. A uniform settlement of the bridge substructure units, including abutments, and piers and bents, has little effect on the structure. Uniform settlements of one foot have been detected on small bridges with no signs of distress.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id168" title="chapter12">
				Differential settlement can produce severe distress in a bridge. Differential settlement may occur between different substructure units, causing damage of varying magnitude depending on span length and bridge type (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-39" title="Go to Figure 12.1.39">see Figure 12.1.39</a>). It may also occur under a single substructure unit (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-40" title="Go to Figure 12.1.40">see Figure 12.1.40</a>). This may cause an opening of the expansion joint between the abutment and wingwall, or it may cause cracking or tipping of the abutment, pier, or wall.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id169" title="chapter12">
				The most common causes of vertical movement are soil bearing failure, consolidation of soil, scour, undermining and subsidence from mining or solution cavities.

			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4278">
				Bearing Areas
			</h5>
			<p id="_id199" title="chapter12">
				High bearing zones include the bridge seats, the abutment stem and footing connection, and the area where the footing is supported by earth or deep foundations. In timber abutments, look for crushing. Look for cracking or spalling in concrete and masonry members. Examine steel members for buckling or distortion.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4279">
				Shear Zones
			</h5>
			<p id="_id200" title="chapter12">
				Horizontal forces cause high shear zones at the bottom of the backwall, and bottom of abutment stem. In timber abutments, look for splitting. Look for diagonal cracks in concrete and masonry. Examine steel members for buckling or distortion.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4280">
				Flexural Zones
			</h5>
			<p id="_id201" title="chapter12">
				High flexural moments caused by horizontal forces occur at the bottom of the backwall and abutment stem connection. High flexural moments may be occurring at the footing toe and abutment stem. Moments cause compression and tension depending on the load type and location of the member neutral axis. Look for deterioration caused by overstress due to compression or tension caused by flexural moments. Check compression areas for timber splitting, concrete crushing or steel buckling. Examine tension members for cracking or distortion.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4281">
				Areas Exposed to Drainage
			</h5>
			<p id="_id202" title="chapter12">
				Water can leak through the deck joints. Examine areas such as backwalls and bridge seats for signs of water leakage, and dirt and debris build-up. Look for material deficiencies caused by exposure to moisture, such as corrosion and section loss on steel, spalls and delaminations on concrete and decay on timber. Examine the abutment stem at the ground level or water level for similar deteriorations.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id203" title="chapter12">
				Water can build up horizontal pressure behind an abutment. Allowing the water to exit from behind the abutment relieves this pressure. Weep holes, normally four inches in diameter, allow water to pass through the abutment. Sometimes abutments have subsurface drainage pipes that are parallel to the rear face of the abutment stem. These pipes are sloped to drain the water out at the end of the abutment.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id204" title="chapter12">
				Check weep holes and subsurface drainage pipes to see that they are clear and functioning. Be careful of any animal or insect nests that may be in the weep holes. Look for signs of discoloration under the weep holes, which may indicate that the weep holes or substructure drainage pipes are functioning properly. Check the condition of any drainage system that is placed adjacent to the abutment that may result in deterioration of the abutment.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4282">
				Areas Exposed to Traffic
			</h5>
			<p id="_id205" title="chapter12">
				Check for collision damage from vehicles or vessels passing adjacent to structural members.
			</p>
			<p id="_id206" title="chapter12">
				Damage to concrete abutments may include spalls and exposed reinforcement and possibly steel reinforcement section loss. Steel abutments may experience cracks, section loss, or distortion which needs to be documented. Timber abutments may experience cracks, section loss, distortion or loose connections which need to be documented.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4283">
				Areas Previously Repaired
			</h5>
			<p id="_id207" title="chapter12">
				Examine thoroughly any repairs that have been previously made. Determine if repaired areas are sound and functioning properly.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id208" title="chapter12">
				For concrete members, effective repairs and patching are usually limited to protection of exposed reinforcement. For steel members, document the location and condition of any repair plates and their connections. For timber members, document the location and condition of repaired areas and their connections.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4284">
				Scour and Undermining
			</h5>
			<p id="_id209" title="chapter12">
				Scour is the removal of material from a streambed as a result of the erosive action of running water (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-1-50" title="Go to Figure 12.1.50">see Figure 12.1.50</a>). Scour can cause undermining or the removal of supporting foundation material from beneath the abutments when streams or rivers flow adjacent to them. <a class="figureItem" href="chapter13?_id85" title="Go to Topic 13.2">Refer to Topic 13.2</a> for a more detailed description of scour and undermining.

				State and Federal rating guideline systems have been developed to aid in the inspection of substructures. The two major rating guideline systems currently in use are the FHWA's <em>Recording and Coding Guide for the Structural Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges</em> used for the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) component condition rating method and the AASHTO <em>Manual for Bridge Element Inspection </em>for element level condition state assessment method.

				NBI Component Condition Rating Guidelines
			</h4>
			<p id="_id221" title="chapter12">
				Using NBI component condition rating guidelines, a one-digit code on the Federal Structure Inventory and Appraisal (SI&amp;A) sheet indicates the condition of the entire substructure including abutments and piers. Component condition rating codes range from 9 to 0, where 9 is the best rating possible. <a class="figureItem" href="chapter4?_id59" title="Go to Topic 4.2">See Topic 4.2</a> (Item 60) for additional details about NBI component condition rating guidelines.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id222" title="chapter12">
				Consider previous inspection data along with current inspection findings to determine the correct component condition rating. Recognize that abutments may be affected by scour or other conditions that may only be able to be accessed and evaluated by a separate underwater inspection. Therefore, the results of both the routine and underwater inspection, if applicable, are integrated and evaluated together to arrive at the correct component condition rating for the substructure. Note the findings of the underwater inspection in the narrative portion of the routine inspection report as documentation and justification for the determined substructure component condition rating code.

				12.2.1 Introduction

			<p id="_id281" title="chapter12">
				A pier or bent is an intermediate substructure unit located between the ends of a bridge. Its function is to support the bridge at intermediate intervals with minimal obstruction to the flow of traffic or water below the bridge (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-2-1" title="Go to Figure 12.2.1">see Figure 12.2.1</a>). There is no functional difference between piers and bents. A pier generally has only one column or shaft supported by one footing. Bents have two or more columns and each column is supported by an individual footing.

				Pile bents may be constructed of concrete, steel or timber. Typically, piles are driven in place and support a continuous cap or timber cap for timber piles.
			</p>
			<p id="_id310" title="chapter12">
				Two other specialized types of piers include the hollow pier<strong> </strong> and the integral pier. Hollow piers are usually tall shaft type piers built for bridges crossing deep valleys Being hollow greatly reduces the dead load of the pier and increases its ductility. Whether precast or cast-in-place, hollow piers are constructed in segments. If precast, the segments are post-tensioned together and the joints are epoxy-sealed. The decrease in the dead load, or self-weight, of the piers provides eases in transporting segments to the site, and the high ductility provides for better performance against seismic forces. 
		  </p>
			<p id="_id311" title="chapter12">
				Integral piers incorporate the pier cap into the depth of the superstructure. Integral piers provide for a more rigid structure, and they are typically used in situations where vertical clearance beneath the structure is limited. Integral piers may consist of steel or cast-in-place concrete caps within a girder superstructure. The concrete cap is likely to be post-tensioned rather than conventionally reinforced (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-2-10" title="Go to Figure 12.2.10">see Figures 12.2.10</a> thru <a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-2-12" title="Go to Figure 12.2.12">12.2.12</a>).

				Primary and Secondary Reinforcement
			</h4>
			<p id="_id331" title="chapter12">
				The pattern of primary reinforcement for concrete piers depends upon the pier configuration. Piers with relatively small columns, whether of the single shaft, multi-column, or column and web wall design, have heavy vertical reinforcement confined within closely spaced ties or spirals in the columns. Pier caps are reinforced according to their beam function. Cantilevered caps have primary tension steel near the top surface. Caps spanning between columns have primary tension steel near the bottom surface. Primary shear steel consists of vertical stirrups, usually more closely spaced near support columns or piles. 
			</p>
			<p id="_id332" title="chapter12">
				Wall type piers are more lightly reinforced, but still have significant vertical reinforcement to resist horizontal loads. 
			</p>
			<p id="_id333" title="chapter12">
				If primary steel is not required at a given location, then secondary reforcement for temperature and shrinkage is provided. Each concrete face is reinforced in both the vertical and horizontal directions.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id334" title="chapter12">
				Pier foundations are likewise reinforced to match their function in resisting applied loads. Shear stirrups are generally not required for footings as they are designed thick enough to permit only the concrete to resist the shear. Modern designs, however, do incorporate seismic ties (vertical bars with hooks at each end) to tie the top and bottom mats of rebar together.

				Foundation Types
			</h4>
			<p id="_id357" title="chapter12">
				Foundations are critical to the stability of the bridge since the foundation ultimately supports the entire structure. There are two basic types of bridge foundations:
		  </p>
			<ul id="_id844" title="chapter12">
				<li id="_id696" title="chapter12">
					Spread footings
				</li>
				<li id="_id697" title="chapter12">
					Deep foundations
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="_id358" title="chapter12">
				Spread footing and deep foundations are described on page 12.1.16 of <a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?_id5" title="Go to Topic 12.1">Topic 12.1</a>, Abutments and Wingwalls.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Section-Heading" id="_id359" title="chapter12">
				Pier Protection
			</h4>
			<p id="_id360" title="chapter12">
				Piers are vulnerable to collision damage from trucks, trains, ships, ice flows and waterborne debris. Wall type piers are resistant to this type of collision damage and for this reason are often used in navigable waterways and waterways subject to freezing. Web walls also serve to protect columns (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-2-24" title="Go to Figure 12.2.24">see Figures 12.2.24</a> and <a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-2-25" title="Go to Figure 12.2.25">12.2.25</a>). External barriers are often provided for single- or multi-column piers. Dolphins are single, large diameter, sand-filled, sheet pile cylinders; clusters of timber piles or steel tubes; or large concrete blocks placed in front of a pier to protect it from collision (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-2-26" title="Go to Figure 12.2.26">see Figures 12.2.26</a> and <a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-2-27" title="Go to Figure 12.2.27">12.2.27</a>). Fenders are protective fences surrounding a pier to protect it from marine traffic. They may consist of timber bent arrangements, steel or concrete frames, or cofferdam sheets (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-2-29" title="Go to Figure 12.2.28">see Figures 12.2.28</a> and <a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-2-29" title="Go to Figure 12.2.29">12.2.29</a>).

				12.2.3 Inspection Methods and Locations
			</h3>
			<p id="_id375" title="chapter12">
				Inspection methods for piers and bents are similar to superstructures, particularly when it involves material deterioration. 
			</p>
			<h4 class="Section-Heading" id="_id376" title="chapter12">
				Methods
			</h4>
			<p id="_id377" title="chapter12">
				There are three basic methods used to inspect a member. Depending on the type of inspection, the inspector may be required to use only one individual method or all methods. They include:
		  </p>
			<ul id="_id845" title="chapter12">
				<li id="_id698" title="chapter12">
					Visual
				</li>
				<li id="_id699" title="chapter12">
					Physical
				</li>
				<li id="_id700" title="chapter12">
					Advanced inspection methods
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="_id378" title="chapter12">
				The inspection method used is based on the type of material the pier or bent is made of and the methods are similar to the inspection of superstructures. See <a class="figureItem" href="chapter6?_id16" title="Go to Topic 6.1">Topics 6.1</a> and <a class="figureItem" href="chapter15?_id1" title="Go to Topic 15.1">15.1</a> (Timber), <a class="figureItem" href="chapter6?_id213" title="Go to Topic 6.2">Topics 6.2</a> and <a class="figureItem" href="chapter15?_id58" title="Go to Topic 15.2">15.2</a> (Concrete), <a class="figureItem" href="chapter6?_id576" title="Go to Topic 6.3">6.3</a> and <a class="figureItem" href="chapter15?_id162" title="Go to Topic 15.3">15.3</a> (Steel), or <a class="figureItem" href="chapter6?_id798" title="Go to Topic 6.4">Topic 6.4</a> (Stone Masonry) for specific material defects and inspection methods.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4286">
				Visual
			</h5>
			<p id="_id379" title="chapter12">
				There are two types of visual inspections that may be required of an inspector. The first, called a routine inspection, involves reviewing the previous inspection report and visually examining the members of the bridge. A routine inspection involves a visual assessment to identify obvious deficiencies.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id380" title="chapter12">
				The second type of visual inspection is called an in-depth inspection. An in-depth inspection is an inspection of one or more members above or below the water level to identify any deficiencies not readily detectable using routine methods. Hands-on inspection may be necessary at some locations. This type of visual inspection requires the inspector to visually assess all deficient surfaces at a distance no further than an arm’s length. Surfaces are given close visual attention to quantify and qualify any deficiencies.

				Physical
			</h5>
			<p id="_id414" title="chapter12">
				Once the deficiencies are identified visually, physical methods are used to verify the extent of the deficiencies. Carefully measure and record deficiencies found during physical inspection methods.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id415" title="chapter12">
				Areas of concrete or rebar deterioration identified visually need to be examined physically using an inspection hammer. This hands-on effort verifies the extent of the deficiency and its severity. A delaminated area has a distinctive hollow &#8220;clacking&#8221; sound when tapped with a hammer. The location, length and width of cracks found during the visual inspection need to be measured and recorded.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id416" title="chapter12">
				For steel members, the main physical inspection methods involve the use of an inspection hammer or wire brush. Excessive hammering, brushing or grinding may close surface cracks and make the cracks difficult to find. Corrosion results in loss of member material. This partial loss of cross section due to corrosion is known as section loss. Section loss may be measured using a straight edge and a tape measure. However, a more exact method of measurement, such as calipers or an ultrasonic thickness gauge (D-meter), are used to measure the remaining section of steel. The inspector removes all corrosion products (rust scale) prior to taking measurements.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id417" title="chapter12">
				For timber members, an inspection hammer is used to tap on areas and determine the presence and extent of internal decay. This is done by listening to the sound the hammer makes. If it sounds hollow, internal decay may be present.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4288">
				Advanced Inspection Methods
			</h5>
			<p id="_id418" title="chapter12">

			</p>
			<ul id="_id857" title="chapter12">

				Bearing Areas
			</h5>
			<p id="_id447" title="chapter12">
				Differential settlement or excessive longitudinal or transverse forces, such as those experienced during an earthquake, may cause rotational movement (tipping) and lateral (horizontal) movement of piers or bents.
			</p>
			<p id="_id448" title="chapter12">
				High bearing zones include the bridge seats, the pier cap, the pier shaft or bent column/footing connection, and the area where the footing is supported by earth or deep foundations. In timber piers or bents, look for crushing. Look for cracking or spalling in concrete and masonry members. Examine steel members for buckling or distortion.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4291">
				Shear Zones
			</h5>
			<p id="_id449" title="chapter12">
				Vertical forces cause high shear zones in pier caps close to points of support. Horizontal forces cause high shear zones on the bottom of the pier shaft or bent column. In timber piers or bents, look for splitting. Look for diagonal cracks in concrete and masonry. Examine steel members for buckling or distortion.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4292">
				Flexural Zones
			</h5>
			<p id="_id450" title="chapter12">
				Check the pier cap for signs of overstress in the positive and negative bending moment regions. High flexural moments caused by horizontal forces occur at the bottom of the pier shaft or bent column. High flexural moments may be occurring at the footing toe/pier shaft. Moments cause compression and tension depending on the load type and location of the member neutral axis. Look for deficiencies caused by overstress due to compression or tension caused by flexural moments. Check compression areas for splitting, crushing or buckling. Examine tension members for cracking or distortion. 
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4293">
				Areas Exposed to Drainage
			</h5>
			<p id="_id451" title="chapter12">
				Water can leak through the deck joints. Examine areas below deck joints for signs of water leakage, and dirt and debris build-up. Look for material deficiencies caused by exposure to moisture, such as corrosion and section loss on steel, spalls and delaminations on concrete and decay on timber. Examine the piers and bents at the ground level or water level for similar deteriorations.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4294">
				Areas Exposed to Traffic
			</h5>
			<p id="_id452" title="chapter12">
				Check for collision damage from vehicles passing adjacent to structural members. 
		  </p>
			<p id="_id453" title="chapter12">
				Damage to concrete piers or bents may include spalls and exposed reinforcement and possibly steel reinforcement section loss. Steel piers or bents may experience cracks, section loss, or distortion which needs to be documented. Timber piers and bents may experience cracks, section loss, distortion or loose connections which need to be documented.
		  </p>
			<h5 title="chapter12" id="_id4295">
				Areas Previously Repaired
			</h5>
			<p id="_id454" title="chapter12">
				Examine thoroughly any repairs that have been previously made. Determine if repaired areas are sound and functioning properly.
		  </p>
			<p id="_id455" title="chapter12">
				For concrete members, effective repairs and patching are usually limited to protection of exposed reinforcement (<a class="figureItem" href="chapter12?figure-12-2-50" title="Go to Figure 12.2.50">see Figure 2.1.50</a>). For steel members, document the location and condition of any repair plates and their connections. For timber members, document the location and condition of repaired areas and their connections.

				Scour and Undermining
			</h5>
			<p id="_id458" title="chapter12">
				Scour is the removal of material from a streambed as a result of the erosive action of running water. Scour can cause undermining or the removal of supporting foundation material from beneath the piers or bents when streams or rivers flow adjacent to them. <a class="figureItem" href="chapter13?_id85" title="Go to Topic 13.2">Refer to Topic 13.2</a> for a more detailed description of scour and undermining.

			<p id="_id459" title="chapter12">
				Inspection for scour includes probing around the pier or bent footing for signs of undermining. Sometimes silt loosely fills in a scour hole and offers no protection or bearing capacity for the pier or bent footing.

				12.2.4 Evaluation
			</h3>
			<p id="_id475" title="chapter12">
				State and Federal rating guideline systems have been developed to aid in the inspection of substructures. The two major rating guideline systems currently in use are the FHWA's <em>Recording and Coding Guide for the Structural Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges</em> used for the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) component condition rating method and the AASHTO <em>Manual for Bridge Element Inspection</em> for element level condition state assessment method.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Section-Heading" id="_id476" title="chapter12">
				NBI Component Condition Rating Guidelines
			</h4>
			<p id="_id477" title="chapter12">
				Using NBI component condition rating guidelines, a one-digit code on the Federal Structure Inventory and Appraisal (SI&amp;A) sheet indicates the condition of the entire substructure including abutments and piers. Component condition rating codes range from 9 to 0, where 9 is the best rating possible. <a class="figureItem" href="chapter4?_id59" title="Go to Topic 4.2">See Topic 4.2</a> (Item 60) for additional details about NBI component condition rating guidelines.  
			</p>
			<p id="_id478" title="chapter12">
				Consider previous inspection data along with current inspection findings to determine the correct component condition rating. Recognize that piers may be affected by scour or other conditions that may only be able to be accessed and evaluated by a separate underwater inspection. Therefore, the results of both the routine and underwater inspection, if applicable, are integrated and evaluated together to arrive at the correct component condition rating for the substructure. Note the findings of the underwater inspection in the narrative portion of the routine inspection report as documentation and justification for the determined substructure component condition rating code.

				The unit quantity for the pier walls, pier caps, and pile caps is fee, measured horizontally across their length. The total length is distributed among the four available condition states depending on the extent and severity of the deficiency. The unit quantity for columns and piles is each, and the total quantity is placed in one of the available condition states depending on the extent and severity of the deficiency. The unit quantity for protective coatings and protective systems is square feet, with the total area distributed among the four available conditions states depending on the extent and severity of the deficiency. Condition State 1 is the best possible rating. See the <em>AASHTO Manual for Bridge Element Inspection</em> for condition state descriptions.
